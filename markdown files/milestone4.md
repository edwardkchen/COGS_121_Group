The biggest difference is in the profile page. As we added the Fitbit API to the app, we are now able to grab the data from the user's account and display it in the profile page. We added two button for users to connect the web app to their Fitbit account, and to display their basic information.

We changed all html files to handlebar files this week.

As we haven't started actually designing the user interface yet, our UI skeletons are still kind of "primitive" and simple. We focused mostly on connecting the API and the database. Next time we will be able to better visualize our data!
